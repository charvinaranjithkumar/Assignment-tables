                        The largest human source of carbon dioxide emissions is from the combustion of fossil fuels. This produces 87% of human
                        carbon dioxide emissions. Burning these fuels releases energy which is most commonly turned into heat, electricity or
                        power for transportation. Some examples of where they are used are in power plants, cars, planes and industrial
                        facilities. In 2011, fossil fuel use created 33.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. <p>The 3 types of fossil fuels that are used the most are coal, natural gas and oil. Coal is responsible for 43% of carbon
                        dioxide emissions from fuel combustion, 36% is produced by oil and 20% from natural gas.</p> <p> Coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel. For every tonne of coal burned, approximately 2.5 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e are produced. Of all the different types of fossil fuels, coal produces the most carbon dioxide. Because of this and it's high rate of
                        use, coal is the largest fossil fuel source of carbon dioxide emissions. Coal represents one-third of fossil fuels'
                        share of world total primary energy supply but is responsible for 43% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use.</p> <p>Anything involving fossil fuels has a carbon dioxide emission ticket attached. So for example, burning these fuels
                        releases energy but carbon dioxide also gets produced as a byproduct. This is because almost all the carbon that is
                        stored in fossil fuels gets transformed to carbon dioxide during this process.</p> <p> The three main economic sectors that use fossil fuels are: electricity/heat, transportation and industry. The first two
                        sectors, electricity/heat and transportation, produced nearly two-thirds of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2010.</p>

                        exclusively to meet those needs. Since the 1990s, transport related emissions have grown rapidly, increasing by 45% in
                        less than 2 decades.<p>Road transport accounts for 72% of this sector's carbon dioxide emissions.Automobiles, freight and light-duty trucks are the main sources of emissions for the whole transport sector and
                        emissions from these three have steadily grown since 1990. Apart from road vehicles, the other important sources of

                        vehicles used in the transportation sector, ships burn the dirtiest fuel on the market, a fuel that is so unrefined that
                        it can be solid enough to be walked across at room temperature.</p><p>Because of this, marine shipping is responsible for over 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.This is more than the annual emissions of several industrialized countries (Germany, South Korea, Canada, UK, etc.) and
                        this sector continues to grow rapidly.

Emissions caused by the transportation of

                        impact on climate change. This trend started in the 1990's and has continued ever since causing an increase in indirect
                        emissions.</p><p>The emissions caused by the transportation of goods are examples of indirect emissions since the consumer has no direct
                        control of the distance between the factory and the store. The emissions caused by people traveling (by car, plane,
                        train, etc...) are examples of direct emissions since people can chose where they are going and by what method.</p><p>Since the distance traveled by goods during production is continuing to grow, this is putting more pressure on the
                        transportation industry to bridge the gap and ends up creating more indirect emissions. What's worse is that 99% of the
                        carbon dioxide emissions caused by transportation of people and goods all over the world comes from the combustion of

                            dioxide emissions and contributed 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2011.1 Land use changes are when the
                            natural environment is converted into areas for human use like agricultural land or settlements. From 1850 to 2000, land
                            use and land use change released an estimated 396-690 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, or about
                            28-40% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.<p>eforestation has been responsible for the great majority of these emissions. Deforestation is the permanent removal of
                            standing forests and is the most important type of land use change because its impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
                            Forests in many areas have been cleared for timber or burned for conversion to farms and pastures. When forested land is
                            cleared, large quantities of greenhouse gases are released and this ends up increasing carbon dioxide levels in three
                            different ways.
                            
                            Trees act as a carbon sink. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. When forests are cleared
                            to create farms or pastures, trees are cut down and either burnt or left to rot, which adds carbon dioxide to the
                            atmosphere.
                            
                            Since deforestation reduces the amount of trees, this also reduces how much carbon dioxide can be removed by the Earth's
                            forests. When deforestation is done to create new agricultural land, the crops that replace the trees also act as a
                            carbon sink, but they are not as effective as forests. When trees are cut for lumber the wood is kept which locks the
                            carbon in it but the carbon sink provided by forests is reduced because of the loss of trees.</p><p>Deforestation also causes serious changes in how carbon is stored in the soil. When forested land is cleared, soil
                            disturbance and increased rates of decomposition in converted soils both create carbon dioxide emissions. This also
                            increases soil erosion and nutrient leaching which further reduces the area's ability to act as a carbon sink.</p>

                                There are many industrial processes that produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide emissions as a by product of
                                chemical reactions needed in their production process. Industrial processes account for 4% of human carbon dioxide
                                emissions and contributed 1.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2011.<p>Many industrial processes emit carbon dioxide directly through fossil fuel combustion as well indirectly through the use
                                of electricity that is generated using fossil fuels. But there are four main types of industrial process that are a
                                significant source of carbon dioxide emissions: the production and consumption of mineral products such as cement, the
                                production of metals such as iron and steel, as well as the production of chemicals and petrochemical products.</p><p>Cement production produces the most amount of carbon dioxide amongst all industrial processes. To create the main
                                ingredient in cement, calcium oxide, limestone is chemically transformed by heating it to very high temperatures. This
                                process produces large quantities of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of the chemical reaction. So much so that making 1000
                                kg of cement produces nearly 900 kg of carbon dioxide.</p><p>Steel production is another industrial process that is an important source of carbon dioxide emissions. To create steel,
                                iron is melted and refined to lower its carbon content. This process uses oxygen to combine with the carbon in iron

            Apart from being created by human activities, carbon dioxide is also released into the atmosphere by natural processes.
            The Earth's oceans, soil, plants, animals and volcanoes are all natural sources of carbon dioxide emissions.<p>Human sources of carbon dioxide are much smaller than natural emissions but they upset the balance in the carbon cycle
            that existed before the Industrial Revolution. The amount of carbon dioxide produced by natural sources is completely
            offset by natural carbon sinks and has been for thousands of years. Before the influence of humans, carbon dioxide
            levels were quite steady because of this natural balance.</p><p>42.84 percent of all naturally produced carbon dioxide emissions come from ocean-atmosphere exchange. Other important

                        The largest natural source of carbon dioxide emissions is from ocean-atmosphere exchange. This produces 42.84% of

                        surface. Annually this process creates about 330 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.<p>Many molecules move between the ocean and the atmosphere through the process of diffusion, carbon dioxide is one of
                        them. This movement is in both directions, so the oceans release carbon dioxide but they also absorb it. The effects of
                        this movement can be seen quite easily, when water is left to sit in a glass for long enough, gases will be released and
                        create air bubbles. Carbon dioxide is amongst the gases that are in the air bubbles.</p>

                        The process uses oxygen to break down nutrients like sugars, proteins and fats. This releases energy that can be used by
                        the organism but also creates water and carbon dioxide as byproducts.</p>

                        natural emissions. Many organisms that live in the Earth's soil use respiration to produce energy. Amongst them are
                        decomposers who break down dead organic material. Both of these processes releases carbon dioxide as a byproduct.
                        Annually these soil organisms create about 220 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.<p>Any respiration that occurs below-ground is considered soil respiration. Plant roots, bacteria, fungi and soil animals
                        use respiration to create the energy they need to survive but this also produces carbon dioxide. Decomposers that work

                        to absorb these gases, while passing through the Earth's mantle and crust. During eruptions, the gases are then released
                        into the atmosphere.</p>
